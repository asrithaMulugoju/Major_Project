# Hybrid Topic Model to Unravel Special Needs in Children with JN. 1 Variant, Covid-19 and GX_P2V Virus using Multi-viewpoints Similarity Metrics
This project is investigates the effectiveness of hybrid topic models utilizing multi-viewpoint similarity metrics for clustering issues related to children with special needs X-Virus, Covid-19 and (GX-P2V)- Pangolin CoronaVirus. 
Addressing challenges in theme extraction from extensive datasets, especially on platforms like Twitter, requires robust cluster tendency identification and efficient text pre-processing. Traditional topic models face hurdles due to their reliance on infrequent words in tweets and the manual determination of clustering parameters using distance metrics. 
These proposed hybrid models, employing multi-viewpoint similarity metrics, address the complexities of high computing and convergence speed. 
External validity indices assess cluster quality, while internal validity indices evaluate clustering structure. 
Empirical analysis underscores the efficacy  of the proposed hybrid models, notably Visual Non-Matrix Factorization (VIS NMF) and Visual Assessment of Cluster Tendency, surpassing alternative models. 
This study provides valuable insights into the application of hybrid topic models and multi-viewpoint similarity metrics, enhancing the compression and analysis of discussions related to children with special needs in social media, particularly on Twitter.
The main motto of this project is to visually represent the issues of children needs.
